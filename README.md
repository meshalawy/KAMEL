# KAMEL
Trajectory imputation is the process of filling the gaps between observed GPS points, which has an important effect in increasing the accuracy of the trajectories and their applications. KAMEL is a scalable BERT-based system for trajectory imputation. KAMEL does not need to know the underlying road network. Instead, KAMEL maps this problem to finding a missing word and NLP, and uses state-of-the-art NLP tools to solve it. KAMEL utilizes the BERT NLP model for this task. However, BERT, as is, does not lend itself to the special characteristics of the trajectory imputation problem. Hence, KAMEL architecture is composed of several modules that adapt the nature of trajectory data to be more fit for BERT input and output, inject spatial-awareness in both the input and output of BERT, and allow imputing multiple points for each trajectory gap.
